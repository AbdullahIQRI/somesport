    <h4>my holiday was as bad as not having any pizza,if you picture what I am saying correctly you will understand that it was horrible. Not horrible like not getting anything for your birthday. Long story short all we did was sleep,watch tv, and look at rocks. You don't need to have a lot of things to make a bland 10 day holiday fun we learned  after day 3 That it is imagination. Imagination made a great toll on a bland 10 day holiday by us playing with toys to us going to MARS.</h4>
